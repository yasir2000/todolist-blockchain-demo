. NodeJS is used to develop, test and deploy the app.

Used stack:
1- Ganash : self-hosted image for Blockchain network
2- Ganash-CLI:
3- Truffle : framework used to interact with immutable smart contracts inside blockchain
4- Metamask : API used to host accounts and make transactions with Blockchain networks, like Etherium, ..etc
